# Summary

ReadyPing is a comprehensive restaurant ordering system that streamlines the food ordering process through real-time notifications, QR code technology, and WhatsApp integration. The system consists of three main components: a customer mobile application, a restaurant management application, and a backend API server. ReadyPing addresses the common challenges in restaurant ordering such as order tracking, customer communication, and real-time status updates.

# Statement of need

Traditional restaurant ordering systems often lack real-time communication capabilities, leading to poor customer experience and operational inefficiencies. Research has shown that customer waiting experiences significantly impact service quality and satisfaction [@davis1998service; @maister1985psychology]. Common issues include:

- **Delayed notifications**: Customers are unaware when their food is ready, leading to frustration and reduced satisfaction
- **Poor order tracking**: Limited visibility into order preparation status creates uncertainty for customers
- **Communication gaps**: No direct communication channel between restaurants and customers
- **Manual processes**: QR code generation and order management require manual intervention
- **Congestion management**: Small restaurants struggle with time-slot scheduling to reduce customer wait times [@bapat2015time]

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of smartphone-based alert systems in fast-food service optimization [@zhang2020smartphone] and WhatsApp-based notifications for improving customer satisfaction in food service [@khurana2021whatsapp]. ReadyPing builds upon this research by providing:

- **Real-time WhatsApp notifications** when orders are ready, addressing the communication gap identified in food service research
- **QR code scanning** for seamless restaurant discovery and reduced manual processes
- **Live order tracking** with status updates to improve customer waiting experiences
- **Automated order management** for restaurants to optimize operations
- **Cross-platform mobile applications** for both customers and restaurants

The system is particularly valuable for small to medium-sized restaurants that need an affordable, easy-to-implement solution for modernizing their ordering process and improving customer satisfaction through better communication and reduced wait times.
